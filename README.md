# Internship Journal

## Week 1

Just a little background story. I am a 3rd-year student of Software Development course in Carlow IT in Ireland. At the end of year three, all students need to find themselves an internship or they need to do a project.
I was lucky and I landed myself an internship as the Open Source Developers Advocate.
I will use this blog to hone my writing skills and also to document my journey for the next few months.

## Day 1

Monday the 4th of April was my first meeting with my mentor - Lukasz who is on the Technical Steering Committee(TSC) for the oversight of the AsyncAPI Initiative and Developer Relations Manager at Postman.

During the meeting, he explained how we are going to work and in the end, I got my assignment. I need to research "How fast and for free you can set up a blog using Tailwind CSS and GitHub".
When I finish researching then I need to set up my blog and write about it.

I forgot to mention that this is a remote internship so it is somehow tricky. It requires preparation and self-planning which ain't easy.

After the call, I was thinking for a second and decided that I want to start fresh.

My laptop is 5 years old, dual-boot Windows 10 and Lubuntu, which over recent months accumulated loads of important stuff(Windows) and other not so important things(Lubuntu).
I concluded that I will replace the Linux partition with some fresh and modern distribution.

Well... That was some experience. During that day, I managed to install and get rid of a few distros like ArcoLinux, Linux Mint LMDE 5 "Elsie", and EndeavourOS.

Each gave me some issues with my graphics card. All those who are familiar with Linux, know that NVidia is not good at supporting Linux. Great Linus Torvalds had something to say in that matter before ðŸ˜‰.
Anyway, after further research, I installed Pop!_OS and it just works like a charm. I must say that it works even better than on Windows.

After installing all required software - Slack, Discord, favourite browsers and Visual Studio Code I finished for a day.
BTW, if anyone of you dear readers, are fans of dark themes(I like it dark, like my soul ðŸ˜ˆ) I recommend you to check this cool website <https://draculatheme.com> which will help you to go to the dark side with all bells and whistles.

## Day 2

Today I started researching the first part of the assignment which is how to build a blog with GitHub.

While doing the research, I noticed that I need to cool down my expectations. In my head I already imagined my mentor tapping his fingers on the table and looking at the watch expecting a good bit of the assignment done. I know he isn't like that but this is what is projecting in my head.

I started writing my journal which I will be sharing on my blog. I am using VSC and markdownlint extension to highlight any issues.

## Day 3

What a start to a day! After all that praising first thing I had to deal with were the graphic card issues. When I booted my laptop this morning only my secondary monitor was working and my laptop screen was blank. So after deleting and installing drivers, and a few hours later I have a working system again. I have rebooted it a few times just to make sure that this is not a fluke and it looks like that the issue is fixed.

What caused it? Remains a mystery. Thanks, NVidia ðŸ˜ .

## Day 4

Today I was able to experience and appreciate remote work. I had a few unexpected things to do in the morning and... No problem. I did what I had to do and then I just started working on my assignment. I still trying mentally switch to that way of work.

From "Am I allowed doing this?", "This feels weird" to " This is a cool way to work!". As long as I do my job I am ok.

Blilliant ðŸ˜€.

## Day 5

Not much was happening today. Spent most of the day taking screenshots and writing my blog on "How to use GitHub Pages to host a blog." To be honest it is taking longer than I was expecting. It is almost finished. Hopefully, I will post it tomorrow ðŸ¤ž. 

## Week 2

Along with this journal and writing a blog, I am doing #100DaysOfCode. I understand that I should be logging some activity every day but I am a dad and weekends are reserved for my family so.. No entries over the weekend. 

Also, it was my birthday so there is no way that I would be doing any coding at all. Here is the delicious cake I have enjoyed yesterday ðŸ˜‹.

## Day 6

Today I had my weekly call with my mentor. Just to make sure that I am on the right track( and working ðŸ˜ƒ). I have advised him that I am almost finished with the first blog. I have raised my concerns and he gave me a few handy tips. Fingers crossed that today I will share that post.
